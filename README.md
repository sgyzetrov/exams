# My first fork in GitHub

## This is my second day in GitHub, I'm just looking around, and screwing around...

I just joined yesterday, well technically 23 hrs ago. This fork is something I've always wanted in the past. 

Yes, I did not have a GitHub account in the past, so I just bookmarked the page that intrigues me in my browser. But then it hit me,
isn't it time for me to register my own GitHub account and really start to dive in? I'm already in my junior year in college, not
having a GitHub just doesn't seem right. And so I did. 

Now I'm happily forking all the things that used to caught my eyes but I can't fork them cuz I don't have a GitHub account. 

I will also, try to create my own awesome repositories here, and pushing my own small projects to GitHub. 

Just so you know, I'm also planning to launch my English blog here using GitHub pages (mostly written in English, I'll do my bestðŸ¤£).

So, that's about it. I look forward to having some great fun here and I hope I can really achieve something while doing so!
